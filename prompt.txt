Act as an expert Senior Software Engineer and UI/UX Designer. I need you to design and build a comprehensive, production-grade web application called "MaintLog Pro". This is a Digital Daily Maintenance Activity Report Logger designed to replace paper logbooks in industrial settings.

### Project Overview
The app mimics a physical daily report sheet used in factories. It tracks maintenance work across three shifts (Night, Morning, Evening) for a specific "Section" (e.g., Filling Dept) on a specific "Date".

### Core Architectural Requirements

1.  **Data Isolation by Section:**
    - The user must be able to switch between different factory "Sections" (e.g., "Filling", "Packaging").
    - **Crucial:** Every piece of data (Saved Reports, Machine Lists, Engineer Lists, Spare Parts Database) must be isolated per section. Changing the section must swap out the entire context.

2.  **Data Structure Concept:**
    - **Report:** Unique per Date and Section. Contains 3 Shifts.
    - **Shift:** Contains a Title, a list of assigned Engineers, and a list of Log Entries.
    - **Log Entry:** Represents a single maintenance task. Contains: Machine Name, Production Line, Work Description, Total Duration, Spare Parts Used (and Quantity), and Notes.

3.  **Persistence & Sync:**
    - The application must persist data so it survives page reloads (LocalStorage).
    - Implement **File System Sync** to allow saving the entire database to a local JSON file that can be synced via cloud storage providers (Google Drive/OneDrive).

### UI Layout & Features

#### 1. Application Shell
-   **Login Screen:** A simple authentication overlay.
-   **Toolbar:** A floating or fixed bar containing global actions:
    -   Save Data.
    -   Clear Current Form.
    -   Export to CSV.
    -   Print/PDF Generation.
    -   App Settings.
    -   Logout.

#### 2. The Report Header
-   Displays the App Title.
-   **Context Selectors:**
    -   **Section:** Dropdown/Input to select the factory area. Must include a way to Manage Sections (Add/Edit/Delete).
    -   **Date:** Date picker to load the specific report for that day.

#### 3. Shift Sections (The Core View)
-   The report is divided into three distinct visual sections: **Night**, **Morning**, and **Evening**.
-   **Color Coding:** Each shift should have a distinct visual theme (e.g., Slate for Night, Yellow for Morning, Orange for Evening).
-   **Shift Header:** Displays Shift Title and an input to select/assign Engineers (Multi-select).

#### 4. The Log Grid (Data Entry)
Each shift contains a dynamic table/grid where users log tasks. Columns include:
1.  **Machine:** Auto-complete input. Must include a "Machine Manager" feature to Add/Edit/Delete machines in the database.
2.  **Line:** (Optional/Configurable) Selector for Production Line number.
3.  **Work Description:** Text area for details. Should support Rich Text and Auto-Complete suggestions.
4.  **Total Time:** Read-only field. Must include a **Time Calculator** tool that allows users to input start/end times (e.g., 10:00-11:00) and auto-calculates the duration.
5.  **Spare Parts:** Read-only summary. Must include a **Spare Parts Database** tool.
    -   *Spare Parts Tool Logic:* A modal to manage a library of parts (Name, Part Number) and select specific parts + quantities for the current task.
6.  **Quantity:** Read-only summary of parts used.
7.  **Notes:** Additional text area.
8.  **Actions:** Ability to delete the row.

### AI Integration (Google Gemini)
-   **Copilot Chat:** A conversational interface to add/edit/delete logs via natural language. Must support **batch operations** and **multi-date** entries.
-   **Analysis Window:** A dashboard where the AI can query the database and generate **charts** (Bar/Pie) and **images**.
-   **Configuration:** Settings for API Key, Model Selection (Flash/Pro), and Thinking Budget.

### Customization & Settings
The app should include a settings menu to configure:
-   **Visual Theme:** Color palettes.
-   **Typography:** Font families and sizes.
-   **Display:** Toggle visibility of specific columns (e.g., hide "Line" or "Time").
-   **Print Mode:** Options to compact the layout for printing.

### Printing Requirements
-   **High Priority:** The app must render a specific "Print View" when the print function is triggered.
-   The print view must look like a formal document (A4 Landscape).
-   Hide all UI controls (buttons, icons, toolbars).
-   Remove shadows/backgrounds to save ink.
-   Ensure borders are sharp and high-contrast.

### Deliverable
Produce the complete source code using a modern frontend technology stack (React + Vite + TypeScript). Ensure the code is modular, robust, and handles edge cases (like missing data) gracefully.
